# Logstash boilerplate

This repository contains a boilerplate for deploying logstash on Scalingo.

You have three different configuration available:

* `logstash.conf`: this configuration will listen for http request
  authenticated by the authentication information passed in the `USER` and
  `PASSWORD` environment variables and send it to and elasticsearch database.
  This will also parse url defined variables and parse the content to search and parse patterns like `key=value`.

By default we are using the `logstash.conf` configuration, in the `web` process of the `Procfile`.

## Configuration

You will need to configure the following environment variables:

* `USER` the username that you will use to authenticate against your logstash
  instance
* `PASSWORD` the password that you will use to authenticate against your
  logstash instance
* `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` the URL of your elasticsearch instance. (If you use our
  Elasticsearch addon, this will be automatically added)

You will also change the `change-me` index name in the output section of your
logstash configuration.

## Updating Logstash version

To update your application with a more recent version of version of **Logstash**,
the most straightforward method is to deploy your application. The
[used buildpack](https://github.com/Scalingo/logstash-buildpack) is defining the
[used version](https://github.com/Scalingo/logstash-buildpack/blob/master/bin/compile#L9),
which can be overrided with the environment variable `LOGSTASH_VERSION`.

To trigger the new deployment, either use:

- The *Manual Deployment* feature of our GitHub or Gitlab
- `git push` deployment after adding an empty commit to your project `git commit --allow-empty -m "New deployment to update logstash"`
